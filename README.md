# Stylus Styles

Custom adjustment to stylesheets for various sites that I use. Deploy with the Stylus browser extension. No guarantees that these adjustments continue to work or even work to begin with.

## Requirements

- [Styles browser plugin](https://add0n.com/stylus.html)

## Install

In the Stylus plugin go to `manage` and under backup use `import.json` to import the current styles.
